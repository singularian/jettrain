# Jet Train
=======

A jet train is a train that can replace commercial aviation 
with jet trains. These would be magnetically levitated or magnetically suspended hover jets that can travel in concrete tubes.
Jet trains would travel at 600 miles an hour or as fast as commercial jets while travelling safely on the ground.
They can use conventional technology and minimize the use of exotic carbon fibre and expensive materials.
A jet train would also eliminate crashing on landing or takeoff.
Unlike Air transportation a jet train does not dissapear.
 

# Advantages
- No delays due to wheather
- No decompression due to altitude. The Jet train travels on the ground at 600 MPH.
- No Air Traffic Control
- Lower emissions from Jet engines
- Less noise as the jet can be isolated to the concrete tunnel tubes
- Prefabricated cheap concrete or composite tunnels tubes that can be linked together to provide jet train transportation.
- Lower incidences of corrosion on the Jet Train due to decompression and compression and wheather.
- Less chance of accidents since the Jet Trains only travel on the ground and rarely ascend above a thousand feet. 
- Eliminating landing or takeoff in a Jet Train.
- Superior to the hyperloop since jets are proven technology.

# Applications 
A Jet Train could replace most forms of aviation with ground centered train travel that is safer.

# Video Windows for Jet Train or Plane Windows
Using Video displays in a Jet Trains or Plane to replace the windows. These would allow for 
scenery to be displayed and remove the windows from the fuselage. Video screens would replace 
the windows in the fuselage.

Each window could be replaced by a series of LCD or LED display panels. They could also be replaced by video
screens running the length of the train or plane and show different locations.

Each video window can show a different video of the outside including a totally non existant view relative. A virtual view
could be show of another city even though the plane or jet is flying at night. It could also show the daytime on the video panels even if it is night time.
